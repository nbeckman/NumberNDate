TODO

Sometimes I go long stretches of time without working on this app, so I can't remember where I am, progress-wise.

Here's some things that need doing:

I think these are the two things I need to do before considering the first version to be
complete.
- Make sure the columns have headers with the same name we're going to insert with; that's
  the only way the row feed works. Or just use the cell feed. Might not be so hard...
  a.) check for heads and use them, b.) if empty write number/date
- There's a bug in the very initial start-up when you refuse to select a spreadsheet by going
  back, then some member variables are not initialized and the button does nothing. Just grey
  out the controls until a spreadsheet has been accepted.
  
More:
- Test out no network connection, make sure it still stores things. 
- Have some text in the ChooseFileActivity before the files are loaded otherwise it looks really weird.
