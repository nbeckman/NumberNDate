TODO

Sometimes I go long stretches of time without working on this app, so I can't remember where I am, progress-wise.

Here's some things that need doing:

I think these are the two things I need to do before considering the first version to be
complete.
- Make sure the columns have headers with the same name we're going to insert with; that's
  the only way the row feed works. Or just use the cell feed. Might not be so hard...
  a.) check for heads and use them, b.) if empty write number/date
- Offline updates really suck. The main activity will not create a spreadsheet service and thus
  no offline updater thread unless we are connected to the network. But in theory, all we really
  need to store is a URL, I am thinking list feed url, and then we should be able to accept updates
  as much as we want. 
  - I think there is something wrong with resuming the checker thread when you leave
    the app and come back.
  
More:
- Have network posting thread look at the network state, and don't try if there is no connection, and/or try less often.
- Have some text in the SpreadsheetFileManager before the files are loaded otherwise it looks really weird.
