TODO

Sometimes I go long stretches of time without working on this app, so I can't remember where I am, progress-wise.

Here's some things that need doing:
- Make sure the columns have headers with the same name we're going to insert with; that's
  the only way the row feed works. Or just use the cell feed. Might not be so hard...
- There's a bug in the very initial start-up when you refuse to select a spreadsheet by going
  back, then some member variables are not initialized and the button does nothing.
