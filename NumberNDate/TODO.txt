Sometimes I go long stretches of time without working on this app, so I can't remember where I am, progress-wise.

Here's some things that need doing:
- Have network posting thread look at the network state, and don't try if there is no connection, and/or try less often.
- Have some text in the SpreadsheetFileManager before the files are loaded otherwise it looks really weird.
- The ability to add new spreadsheets from the app.
- Adding of 'number' and 'date' headers is very limited; we could allow users to choose the terms used. Also, if the
  spreadsheet is not COMPLETELY empty we don't add headers because we are too scared.
